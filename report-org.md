# AI MODEL For detection of learning disabilites 

develop an ai based softeare model for early detection of learning disabilities


# problems 
- dislexia 
- discalculia 
- disgraphia 
- auditory processing disorder
- visual processing disorder


# base idea 
disgraphia - writing test , challenging concepts to put into paper 
           analyzing the handwriting and written information 
           to calculate the probability of disgraphia

dislexia - reading test , challenging words to read and understand
            analyzing the reading speed , mistakes and comprehension 
            to calculate the probability of dislexia


(ADP) auditory processing disorder - listening test , challenging audio clips to listen and understand
            analyzing the listening speed , mistakes and comprehension 
            to calculate the probability of ADP

# application guidelines 
the application will be a web based application 
- with initial test based on the user age , user will be questioned based on his life experinece and feedback 
of likely sysmptoms 
from this the app will recognize the disability and recommende a test 

- the test will be broad  , and is taregeted to detect all disabilites in one go 
but the quiz wiill decide which disability to focus more on based on the answers 

main ui is quizz , to control quizz dynamically we use an agent 

# target audience 

10-8 year old s - early detection is key
fun interactive ui 

**landing page**: should be aimed at parents as the key customer 
including insttructions for the parent on how to help the child take the test
and what to look for in terms of behavior and symptoms

**test page**: should be engaging and interactive for children

the main landing page would be professional ui for parents 
with information about learning disabilities , symptoms and importance of early detection


# developmental delay 

developmental delay of children with age and test score 


# audio test

audio test with camera detection 

"wave your hand" body tracking 


# initrial input 

gender 
age 
name 
current grade ( level of knowledge )
language proficiency

# factors
 screening quizz
