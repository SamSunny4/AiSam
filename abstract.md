### Abstract

Early identification of learning disabilities is essential for ensuring timely educational support and improved developmental outcomes for children. Traditional assessment methods are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and inaccessible to many families, leading to delayed intervention. This project presents a **Learning Disability Detection Software** that provides an ethical, non-invasive, and technology-driven screening approach by integrating parental insights, child-centered interactive assessments, and AI-based behavioral analysis.

The proposed system targets key learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, attention-related learning challenges, and auditory and visual processing disorders. A structured parental questionnaire establishes developmental and environmental context, which dynamically influences the difficulty and focus of interactive, game-based tasks designed for children. During these tasks, the system captures performance metrics, response timing, and behavioral indicators to identify domain-specific learning patterns.

An adaptive scoring and analysis framework generates confidence-weighted screening insights rather than clinical diagnoses, ensuring responsible and transparent use. The final output is a comprehensive, parent-friendly report highlighting potential areas of concern and recommending professional evaluation when necessary. Overall, the system aims to support parents, educators, and specialists in early learning disability screening, enabling informed decision-making and timely intervention while maintaining child engagement, data security, and ethical standards.
