# Early Developmental Screening Quiz

This checklist is organized by age range and skill area to help identify early signs of language, motor, social, and learning differences.

## Toddlers (Ages 1–3)
At this stage, questions focus on the emergence of foundational speech, motor, and social skills.

### Language and Communication
1. Is your child a "late talker"? Did they say their first single words later than 15–16 months, or fail to combine two words (e.g., "more juice") by age two?
2. Does your child struggle to name familiar objects? Do they frequently point and grunt rather than using the word, or do they seem to understand words but cannot produce them (expressive language delay)?
3. Does your child "muddle" words consistently? Do they persistently swap sounds in polysyllabic words (e.g., saying "aminal" for animal or "pusgetti" for spaghetti) beyond the age where this is cute or typical?

### Motor and Sensory
4. Does your child resist activities requiring hand manipulation? Do they avoid holding crayons, stacking blocks, or using a spoon, potentially indicating fine motor weakness?
5. Is your child notably "clumsy"? Do they trip frequently, struggle to pedal a tricycle, or seem unaware of where their body is in space (bumping into things)?

### Social and Attention
6. Does your child respond to their name? If you call them from another room or behind them, do they consistently orient toward you?
7. Does your child engage in pretend play? Do they use toys functionally (e.g., feeding a doll, driving a car) or do they focus only on parts of the toy (e.g., spinning wheels repeatedly)?

## Preschoolers (Ages 3–5)
This is a critical window for identifying precursors to dyslexia (reading), dysgraphia (writing), and dyscalculia (math).

### Pre-Literacy (Dyslexia Indicators)
1. Can your child rhyme? If you say "cat, hat, bat," can they provide another word that matches? Do they struggle to learn simple nursery rhymes or songs?
2. Does your child recognize the letters in their own name? By age 4 or 5, do they still struggle to identify the letters of their name or connect letters to their sounds?
3. Do they have trouble following multi-step instructions? If you say, "Go get your shoes and put them by the door," do they forget the second part or get lost in the sequence?

### Fine Motor (Dysgraphia Indicators)
4. How does your child hold a crayon or pencil? Do they use a mature grip, or do they "fist" the tool? Do they complain that their hand is tired after coloring for a short time?
5. Does your child struggle with self-care fasteners? Are buttons, zippers, and snaps a source of significant frustration or avoidance?
6. Does your child avoid drawing or coloring? While other children enjoy art, does your child actively refuse these activities?

### Cognitive and Math (Dyscalculia/NVLD Indicators)
7. Can your child count small groups of objects? Do they have to count 1-2-3 every time they see three dots, or can they instantly see that there are three (subitizing)?
8. Does your child struggle with temporal concepts? Do they persistently confuse "yesterday," "today," and "tomorrow," or struggle to learn the days of the week in order?
9. Is your child a "Little Professor"? Does your child have a very advanced vocabulary and verbal memory but struggle significantly with puzzles, shapes, or visual-spatial tasks (a sign of Non-Verbal Learning Disability)?

## Early School Age (Ages 5–8)
As formal instruction begins, the gap between ability and achievement becomes clearer.

### Reading and Language
1. Does your child guess at words based on the first letter? Instead of sounding out "house," do they say "home" or "horse"?
2. Is reading laborious and choppy? Does your child read slowly, ignoring punctuation, or skipping small words like "the," "and," or "is"?
3. Does your child struggle to recall the right word? Do they frequently use filler words ("um," "thingy," "stuff") or snap their fingers trying to retrieve a specific word they definitely know?

### Writing and Mechanics
4. Is your child's handwriting messy or inconsistent? Do they mix capital and lowercase letters randomly within words? Is the spacing between words unpredictable?
5. Does your child spell the same word differently in the same document? For example, writing "was," then "wuz," then "saw" on the same page?

### Attention and Organization
6. Does your child lose things constantly? Are backpacks, homework, and lunchboxes frequently lost or left behind?
7. Does your child exhibit "spiky" performance? Are they brilliant at Lego or storytelling but unable to write a simple sentence?

### Family History (Critical Context)
1. Is there a history of learning difficulties in the family? Did a parent or sibling struggle with reading, spelling, or "schoolwork" growing up? (Family history is a strong predictor of heritability.)

If several questions in one domain are answered "yes," consider consulting a pediatrician, early intervention services, or a specialist (speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, educational psychologist) for further evaluation.
