# Priority Plan for Learning Disability Detection Software

## Priority Level 1 – Core Foundation (Must-Have)

These components are **non-negotiable** for a valid, ethical, and functional system.

### 1.1 Parental Questionnaire Module

**Reason for Priority:**
Provides essential developmental context and reduces false positives.

**Deliverables**

* Structured digital form
* Consent acknowledgment
* Secure data storage
* Contextual weighting logic

**Outcome**

* Baseline understanding of the child before assessment begins

---

### 1.2 Child Interactive Quiz Engine (Basic Version)

**Reason for Priority:**
Primary data source for screening learning difficulties.

**Deliverables**

* Reading, math, visual, audio, memory tasks
* Age-based difficulty levels
* Time and accuracy tracking

**Outcome**

* Quantifiable learning performance data

---

### 1.3 Domain-Based Scoring System

**Reason for Priority:**
Raw scores alone are meaningless; domain mapping is essential.

**Deliverables**

* Separate scores for reading, math, attention, etc.
* Performance normalization by age
* Error-pattern analysis

**Outcome**

* Structured screening indicators instead of a single score

---

## Priority Level 2 – Behavioral Intelligence (High Impact)

These features significantly **improve accuracy and credibility**.

### 2.1 Behavioral Tracking (Non-Invasive)

**Reason for Priority:**
Learning issues often appear in behavior before academic failure.

**Deliverables**

* Time-on-task analysis
* Task-switching frequency
* Hesitation and retry tracking

**Outcome**

* Contextual understanding of performance difficulties

---

### 2.2 Adaptive Quiz Flow

**Reason for Priority:**
Reduces stress and improves data quality.

**Deliverables**

* Difficulty auto-adjustment
* Weak-area reinforcement tasks
* Early termination for strong domains

**Outcome**

* Personalized, child-friendly assessment experience

---

## Priority Level 3 – AI & Advanced Analytics (Differentiator)

These make the system **research-grade and innovation-focused**.

### 3.1 AI-Based Pattern Recognition

**Reason for Priority:**
Enables detection of subtle learning disability indicators.

**Deliverables**

* Cross-domain correlation analysis
* Confidence-weighted predictions
* Consistency tracking across tasks

**Outcome**

* Reliable screening insights with reduced bias

---

### 3.2 Camera & Audio-Based Attention Metrics

**Reason for Priority:**
Especially important for ADHD, APD, and VPD indicators.

**Deliverables**

* Gaze stability estimation
* Movement frequency tracking
* Audio response latency

**Outcome**

* Objective attention and processing indicators

---

## Priority Level 4 – Reporting & Explainability (User Trust)

### 4.1 Parent-Friendly Report Generator

**Reason for Priority:**
Parents must understand results without misinterpretation.

**Deliverables**

* Visual charts
* Simple explanations
* Clear disclaimers (screening ≠ diagnosis)

**Outcome**

* High trust and ethical compliance

---

### 4.2 Professional Summary Mode

**Reason for Priority:**
Supports educators and clinicians.

**Deliverables**

* Technical metrics
* Domain score breakdown
* Behavioral correlations

**Outcome**

* Useful for referrals and expert evaluation

---

## Priority Level 5 – Enhancement & Scalability (Optional)

These are **future upgrades**.

### 5.1 Multilingual Support

* Especially valuable for diverse linguistic environments

### 5.2 Longitudinal Tracking

* Progress comparison over months

### 5.3 School Integration Dashboard

* Class-level insights for educators

## Priority Summary Table

| Priority | Focus Area                     | Importance |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| P1       | Questionnaire + Quiz + Scoring | Critical   |
| P2       | Behavioral Tracking            | High       |
| P3       | AI & Camera/Audio Analysis     | High       |
| P4       | Reporting & Explainability     | Medium     |
| P5       | Scalability Features           | Optional   |
